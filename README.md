=========

Following are collections of codes created to learn algorithms
and the Ruby language. Included are: 

  * Graphs data structure; G=(V,E)
  * Depth-first Search algorithm that returns a DFS filtered graph
    with tree, back, forward, and cross edges. 
  * Will include various Minimum Search Tree algorithms and their implementations
    using the graphs. 
    

FUNCTIONAL CODES: 
  * GraphsDS3.rb -> Holds Edge and Graph class
  * DFS2.rb      -> Algorithm for Depth-first search
  * DFS2.demo.rb -> Tests DFS2.rb and GraphsDS3.rb
  
NONFUNCTIONAL CODES: (Kept for historical and reference purposes)
  * GraphsDS.rb
  * GraphsDS2.rb
  * DFS.rb
